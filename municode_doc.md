## Author: Kyle Rose
## Date: 3-17-2025

## Definitions
### General
- Document: A chunk of legal text. Can be standalone or part of a larger law chunk. Ex: "Chapter 3, Section 10, Sub-section 5".
- Node Tree: Shorthand for the nested JSON structure of Municode's API output.
- Node ID: Municode's ID for a chunk of legal text. Appears to be an abbreviation of the document's name. Ex: "COOR_CH1GEPR"

### API-Specific
- DocType: Municode's categorization of the document. Documents are all 1.
- IsAmended: Whether the document has been amended since it was first written.
- IsUpdated: Whether the document has been updated in Municode as compared to current municipal law.
- CompareStatus: Unknown.
- DocOrderId: The ascending order of the document in the municipalities law corpus, starting at 1.
- ChunkGroupStartingNodeId: The top-level node ID of the node tree where the current document is located.
- NodeDepth: How deep in the node tree the current document is located. Higher numbers mean the document is deeper in the nested JSON.
- TitleHtml: The title of the current document in HTML
- Id: The node id of the document.
- Title: The tile of the current document in plain text.
- Content: The legal text itself in HTML.
- AmendedBy: Unknown
- Drafts: Unknown
- SortDate: Unknown
- Footnotes: List of footnotes that the document references

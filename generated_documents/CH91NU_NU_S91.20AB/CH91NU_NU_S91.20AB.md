1.


Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place, and subject of any
hearing before the city council; notice of city council order; and notice of motion
for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as set forth in this section.


a.


Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by a peace officer on the owner of record
or occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If
the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record
or occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be served
by posting it on the premises.


b.


Notice of city council hearing. Written notice of any city council hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall
be served on the owner of record and occupant of the premises either in person or
by certified or registered mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record
is unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the city
council hearing, notice of city council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.


c.


Notice of city council order. Except for those cases determined by the city to require summary enforcement, written
notice of any city council order shall be made as provided in Minn. Stat. ยง 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.

Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for
in Minn. Stat. ยง 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended
from time to time.


2.


Procedure. Whenever a peace officer determines that a public nuisance is being maintained or
exists on the premises in the city, the officer shall notify in writing the owner
of record or occupant of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be
terminated or abated. The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken
to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be abated. If the
notice of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the officer shall
report that fact forthwith to the city council. Thereafter, the city council may,
after notice to the owner or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that
the condition identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order
that if the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the city council,
the city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the city council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement.


3.


Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the notice and
procedure requirements set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit
a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the
city council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer shall determine that a public nuisance exists or
is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance
will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The officer shall notify
in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and
of the city's intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the
city council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The city council
shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice to the owner
or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably
endangered by delay in abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division
(A) of this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the city council
may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.


4.


Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or other process,
from immediately abating any condition which poses an imminent and serious hazard
to human life or safety.

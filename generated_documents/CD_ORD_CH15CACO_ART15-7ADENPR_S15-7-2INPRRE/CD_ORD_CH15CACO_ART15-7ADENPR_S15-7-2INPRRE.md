### ยง 15-7-2 - INSPECTION OF PROPERTY AND RECORDS.

(A)


At all reasonable times, the licensee shall permit any duly authorized representative
of the city to examine all property of the licensee, together with any appurtenant
property of the licensee situated within or without the city, and to examine and transcribe
any and all maps and other records kept or maintained by the licensee or under its
control that relate to license compliance and deal with the operations, affairs, transactions,
or property of the licensee.


(B)


The licensee shall at all times make and keep full and complete plans and records
showing the exact location of all cable system equipment installed or in use in streets,
public rights-of-way, and other places in the city and make them available to the
city for review upon request.


(C)


The licensee shall provide the City Manager maps or sets of maps drawn to scale, showing
the location of the licensee's underground and above ground facilities. Upon request,
such maps or sets of maps shall be provided in an electronic format compatible with
the current city electronic format.


(D)


Plant survey report. Upon request of the city the licensee shall submit to the city an annual plant survey
report that shall be a complete survey of the licensee's plant and a full report thereon.
Such report shall be in sufficient detail to enable the city to ascertain that the
service requirements and technical standards of the FCC and/or the license are achieved
and maintained. If the city has reason to believe that portions or all of the system
do not meet either the FCC technical standards, or those incorporated into the license
agreement, at the city's request, but no more often than once per three years, the
licensee and the city shall agree upon the appointment of a qualified independent
engineer to evaluate and verify the technical performance of the cable system. The
cost of such evaluation shall be borne equally by the licensee and the city.

Editor's note—
Nonamendatory Ord. No. 776, §§ 1—12, adopted May 9, 1990, has been treated by the
editor as superseding former Art. VI, §§ 6-167—6-172, pertaining to similar provisions,
and has been codified herein as a new Art. VI, §§ 6-167—6-178. Formerly, Art. VI originated
from the 1969 Code, §§ 16.30.010—15.30.050 and 15.30.070.

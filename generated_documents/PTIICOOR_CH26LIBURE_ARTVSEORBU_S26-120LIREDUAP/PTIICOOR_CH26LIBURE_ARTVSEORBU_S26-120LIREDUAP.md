### Sec. 26-120. - License required; duties of applicant.

(a)


The following are required to be licensed:


(1)


All owners, clerks, and employees of a sexually oriented business are required to
be licensed to operate or work in said business. The term "employees" includes persons
who work in a sexually oriented business for gratuities or other compensation, and
do not earn wages or a salary.


(2)


All corporations or directors of corporations of any sexually oriented business and
their employees.


(3)


All partners in any sexually oriented business and their employees.


(4)


All executive officers, corporations, partners, and lien holders and their employees
which are associated with any sexually oriented business requiring a license under
this article.


(b)


No person shall work for any sexually oriented business without having at all times
while at work, a valid current Texas driver's license or a state-issued identification
card which depicts a picture of the person and indicates the person's date of birth.


(c)


All potential employees and/or clerks of sexually oriented businesses must comply
with subsections (a), (b), (c) and (h) of this section and sections 26-122(b), 26-123, 26-124, 26-125, 26-126 and 26-129, and not be in violation of section 26-121(a)(1), (3), (4), (6), (8), or (10) before being issued an identification card to
work at the business. Application forms will be provided by the chief of police and
the determination of compliance must be made by the chief of police within 30 days
from time of application.


(d)


An application for a sexually oriented business license must be made on a form provided
by the chief of police. The application must be accompanied by a sketch or diagram
showing the configuration of the premises, including a statement of total floor space
occupied by the business. The sketch or diagram need not be professionally prepared,
but must be drawn to a designated scale or drawn with marked dimensions of the interior
of the premises to an accuracy of plus or minus six inches. Applicants who must comply
with section 26-136 shall submit a diagram meeting the requirements of section 26-136. All locational requirements must be approved by the chief of police within 30 days
from the time the application is filed.


(e)


The applicant for a sexually oriented business license must be qualified according
to the provisions of this article.


(f)


If a person who wishes to operate a sexually oriented business is an individual, such
person must sign the application for a license as applicant. If a person who wishes
to operate a sexually oriented business is other than an individual, each individual
who has an interest in the business must sign the application for a license as applicant
and shall be considered a license if a license is granted.


(g)


The fact that a person possesses any other valid license required by law does not
exempt that person from the requirement of obtaining a sexually oriented business
license. A person who operates a sexually oriented business and possesses another
business license shall comply with the requirements and provisions of this article,
as well as the requirements and provisions of the laws concerning the other license.


(h)


Each applicant shall attach two copies of a recent photo to the application form.


(i)


The application shall be accompanied by the following:


(1)


Payment of the application fee in full;


(2)


If the establishment is a Texas corporation, a certified copy of the articles of incorporation,
together with all amendments thereto;


(3)


If the establishment is a foreign corporation, a certified copy of the certificate
of authority to transact business in this state, together with all amendments thereto;


(4)


If the establishment is a limited partnership formed under the laws of the state,
a certified copy of the certificate of limited partnership, together with all amendments
thereto;


(5)


If the establishment is a foreign limited partnership, a certified copy of the certificate
of limited partnership and the qualification documents, together with all amendments
thereto.


(j)


Each applicant for a business license shall, upon the filing of the application and
payment of the filing fee, place signs (at least 24 inches by 36 inches in size) which
provide notification and information specifically stating "SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS
LICENSE APPLICATION PENDING" and the date on which the application was filed. All
lettering on the signs must be at least 1½ inches by two inches in size for each letter
on the sign. The signs must be of sufficient quantities to be placed upon the property
so as to identify it as being subject to a proposed sexually oriented license. It
shall be the duty of each applicant as to each particular application to erect said
signs along all the property's public road or highway frontage so as to be clearly
visible from the public road or highway. If a property does not have a public road
or highway frontage, then signs shall be placed upon the property in a manner to maximize
the view of said sign when approached from the customary means of approaching the
property. One sign shall be erected for each 300-foot increment of each public road
or highway frontage on said property existing, or any part thereof. Said signs shall
be erected not less than 14 days after the filing of the application for the sexually
oriented business license and remain erected until the application has been approved
by the chief of police.


(k)


Every applicant for a sexually oriented business license shall give notice of the
application by publication at the applicant's expense in two consecutive issues of
a newspaper of general circulation published in the city. The notice shall be printed
in ten-point boldface type and shall include the following:


(1)


The fact that a sexually oriented business license has been applied for;


(2)


The exact location of the place of business for which the permit is sought;


(3)


The names of each owner of the business and, if the business is operated under an
assumed name, the trade name together with the names of all owners; and


(4)


If the applicant is a corporation, the names and titles of all officers.


Such notice shall be printed not less than 14 days after the application is filed
with the chief of police.

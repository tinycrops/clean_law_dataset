### Sec. 8-163. - Wheels, tail skids.

No person operating any aircraft shall use the paved runways unless the aircraft is
equipped with wheels, and no aircraft shall be operated on any part of the airport
with tail skids with such insufficient base area as to cause damage to the airport
surfaces. No aircraft shall be allowed to taxi, land or take off without wheels used
to support the aircraft that may move on the surface of the ground other than skis
on snow, such as surface-scratching tail skids.

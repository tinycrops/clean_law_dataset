### Sec. 74-34. - Certificate of accessibility to public sewer required; administration.

(a)


As a condition precedent to the issuance of any new building permit or new business
license for property within the corporate limits or police jurisdiction, the applicant
shall obtain and present a certificate certifying whether the lot or parcel on which
the proposed construction or business will be situated is a property accessible to
a public sanitary sewer and if the sewer is or will be available in accordance with
this article.


(b)


As a condition precedent to the issuance of a new building permit, the applicant must
also present the required number of certificates of use (sewer taps) indicating all
fees and costs are paid in full. For developments incurring initial fees in excess
of $10,000.00, payment of said excess may be deferred upon written request of applicant
and approval of the city finance department. However, no certificate of occupancy
either residential or commercial shall issue prior to payment in full of all fees
due to the city.


(c)


If a business license is requested, the applicant shall present to the business license
division of the finance department a certificate or letter from the sewer division
that all fees and costs are paid in full or up to date.


(d)


In issuing any such certificate of accessibility, the utilities director shall rely
on the anticipated certificate of occupancy date certified by the applicant. In this
event, the utilities director certifies such lot or parcel as a property accessible
to a public sanitary sewer, based on the intention to extend a public sanitary sewer
to a point contiguous with the property line of such lot or parcel on or before the
anticipated certificate of occupancy date of issuance.

### Section 12. - Zoning map designations.

(1)


When definite distances in feet are not shown on the zoning map the district boundaries
on the zoning map are intended to be along existing street, alley or property lines
or extensions of or from the same. When the location of a district boundary line is
not otherwise determined, it shall be determined by the scale of the map measured
from a given line.


(2)


Where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown
on the zoning map, the Board of Adjustment may apply the designations shown on the
mapped streets in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan for
the particular area in question.

### Sec. 74-20. - Severability.

This chapter and each section and provision of said ordinance hereunder, are hereby
declared to be independent divisions and subdivisions and, not withstanding any other
evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative
intent that if any provisions of said ordinance, or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or provisions
and the application of such sections and provisions to any person or circumstances
other than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it
is hereby declared that such sections and provisions would have been passed independently
of such section or provision so known to be invalid. Should any procedural aspect
of this chapter be invalidated, such invalidation shall not affect the enforceability
of the substantive aspects of this chapter.

in the solicitation for that proposal and shall be consistent with the requirements
of the PPEA and any other applicable law. All such solicitations shall be by issuance
of a written invitation to bid (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP) within the meaning
of "competitive sealed bidding" and "competitive negotiation" as used in the Wise
County Purchasing Policy.



(b)



Any proposal submitted pursuant to the PPEA that is not received in response to an
IFB or RFP shall be an unsolicited proposal under these procedures, including but
not limited to:



(1)



Proposals received in response to a notice of the prior receipt of another unsolicited
proposal as required by the PPEA and provided for below in section 5.5-143(b); and



(2)



Proposals received in response to publicity by the county concerning particular needs
when the county has not issued a corresponding IFB or RFP, even if the county otherwise
has encouraged the submission of proposals pursuant to the PPEA that address those
needs.

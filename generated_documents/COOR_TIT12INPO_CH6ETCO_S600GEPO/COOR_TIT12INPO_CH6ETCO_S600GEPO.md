### Section 600. - General policy.

It is the policy of the City of Tulsa that the proper operation of democratic government
requires that public officials and employees be independently impartial and responsible
to the people of the City; that government decisions and policies be made only through
proper channels of the governmental structure; that no City official should have any
interest, financial, personal or organizational, direct or indirect, or engage in
any business, transaction or activity or incur any obligation that is in conflict
with the proper discharge of their duties in the public interest; that public office
and public employment are positions of public trust imposing the duty of a fiduciary
upon all officers, employees, members of boards and committees and trustees of public
trusts with the City of Tulsa as a beneficiary; and such individuals shall not use
their public positions for personal gain nor should they act in such a way as to give
an appearance of any impropriety.


The purpose of this chapter is to provide direction to City officials of the policy
of the City of Tulsa.


The appropriate appointing authority shall create and maintain such rules as are necessary
to implement and comply with the provisions of this chapter.
